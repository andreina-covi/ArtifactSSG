# EvoViz: Visual Introspection for Genetically-Based Test Coverage Evolution

Repository contains the artifacts to replicate experiments in the paper "EvoViz: Visual Introspection for Genetically-Based Test Coverage Evolution"

# SmallSuiteGenerator and EvoViz examples

To visualize EvoViz examples (of paper) execute the following commands on Terminal where the project was downloaded.
**Hint** We do all experiments on Mac Book Pro and Linux (Debian Stretch), both of 64-bits.

**MacOSX.** 

```
./Pharo-OSX/Pharo.app/Contents/MacOS/Pharo Pharo9_330.image
```

**Linux.** If you have another distribution of Linux it is possible you could have some bugs.

```
./Pharo-Linux/pharo-ui Pharo9_330.image
```

**Windows.** Experiments were tested on Windows 10 (64-bits). Depending on the Windows version you have installed it may be some some UI bugs.

```
cd Pharo-Windows
Pharo.exe ..\Pharo9_330.image
```

**Open the Visualization.**
Execute the code using the green play button (at the top right of the window), write your name on the window that appears and you will see the visualization.
